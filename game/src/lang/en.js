It is often considered the crown jewel of Fiordland National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and draws visitors from all corners of the globe to witness its breathtaking beauty. Despite its name, Milford Sound is not actually a sound but a fiord, which is a narrow, deep inlet of the sea that is surrounded by towering cliffs carved by glaciers over millions of years. The fiord stretches for approximately 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the Tasman Sea into the heart of the Fiordland mountains. The most prominent and iconic feature of Milford Sound is Mitre Peak, a majestic mountain that rises dramatically from the water, reaching a height of around 1,692 meters (5,551 feet). The peak's distinctive shape resembles a bishop's mitre, hence its name.",
